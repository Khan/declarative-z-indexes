# Declarative z-indexes _(declarative-z-indexes)_

> Prevent z-index conflicts by generating them from declarative constraints

Have you ever struggled with exponential z-index wars? Have you ever changed a
z-index only to find that you now need to change several others? Then
declarative z-indexes are for you.

Instead of writing each z-index separately, you write out all of the different
relationships between your z-index layers. Then, suitable z-indexes are
generated for each of the layers. Easy as pie!
